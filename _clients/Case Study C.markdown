description: Worked with a Queensland based Bank to develop an RPA solution for a complex and large internal business process. Focus points during this engagement included RPA process development, collaborating with multiple RPA developers on one complex process build using agile methods (Epics, User Stories, Scrums, Retrospectives, Sprint Planning etc), and leading the overall documentation of the final RPA process solution (Business Rules, How to Handle Exceptions etc).
